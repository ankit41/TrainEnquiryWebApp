   <p>To check your current reservation status enter 10 digit PNR Number in the text box given above and click 'Get PNR Status' button. Do not enter hyphen (-) in the text box as it is not required.</p>

<br>
<p>PNR is short name for 'Passenger Name Record'. It is a record in the database of Indian Railways computer reservation system (IR-CRS) against which journey details for a passenger, or a group of passengers are saved.<br>

To be specific, when a reserved railway ticket is booked for a train in Indian Railways, all the details of passengers are stored in relational database of centralized reservation system. These details are associated with a unique ten digit number. This reference number is called PNR and it is printed on the ticket.<br>

Passenger's personal information like name, age, gender etc. is saved in the database against this reference number. It includes columns to store booking status and current status of the ticket.<br>

As we know every train has limited number of seats, sometime one may not get a confirmed reserved ticket. Booking status of such waitlist (W/L) ticket changes when there is any availability of reserved seats due to cancellation. This new current reservation status is generally known as <b>PNR status</b>.</p>

<b>Types of Waitlist Tickets & Their Confirmation Priority</b>
<br>
<p>Based on some predefined rules, railway allots different types of waitlist quota on tickets when ticket is not confirmed.</p>
<br>
<b>GNWL (General Waiting List):</b><p>Liklihood of confirmation for GNWL ticket is on highest priority. You may get a GNWL quota, if you are starting your journey from a station close to train source station and ending your journey at a station close to train destination station.</p><br>
<b>CKWL (Tatkal Waiting List):</b><p>If you are booking your ticket under tatkal quota, you get CKWL status when tickets are unreserved. It is important to note that GNWL tickets will confirm first and then CKWL. Hence there is a very less chance that a CKWL ticket will be confirmed.</p><br>
<p>Apart from these two popular waiting list quotas, Indian Railways has defined some other W/L quotas in long journey trains like <b>RLWL</b> (Remote Location Waiting List), <b>RQWL</b> (Request Waiting List), <b>PQWL</b> (Pooled Quota Waiting List), <b>RLGN</b> (Remote Location General Waiting List) and RSWL (Roadside Station Waiting List). Confirmation chances for these types of waitlist tickets are very less.</p>
